# üí´ About Me:
üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on improving my skills in machine learning and data engineering by building end-to-end projects involving model training, deployment, and data pipeline automation.<br>üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on AI/ML research projects, open-source data tools, or full-stack applications that apply machine learning in creative or impactful ways.<br>ü§ù I‚Äôm looking for help with MLOps best practices, setting up scalable model deployment, and building real-time data pipelines using tools like Apache Kafka or Airflow.<br>üå± I‚Äôm currently learning advanced topics in deep learning, particularly in the areas of natural language processing and computer vision. I‚Äôm also diving deeper into MLOps workflows using Docker, FastAPI, and CI/CD practices. Alongside that, I‚Äôm strengthening my knowledge in data engineering with technologies like Hadoop, Kafka, and Airflow, while continuing to grow in web development using React and Next.js to deliver solutions.<br>üí¨ Ask me about my journey into AI/ML, how I‚Äôm applying data engineering concepts in hands-on projects, or how I‚Äôm learning to bridge machine learning models with real-world applications through clean and scalable engineering practices.<br>‚ö° Fun fact: I started my tech journey with algorithms, but exploring real-world datasets and understanding how data drives intelligent systems inspired me to dive deep into AI and data engineering. I'm now passionate about building solutions that combine smart algorithms, solid data infrastructure, and user-focused design.<br>
